# Employee-attrition

This project uses machine learning to predict employee attrition by analyzing key factors such as job role, salary, and job satisfaction. By implementing models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, it aims to identify patterns in employee turnover and provide actionable insights for improving retention strategies.

## Project Overview

Employee attrition is a major concern for businesses due to its financial and operational implications. Understanding what drives attrition is crucial for HR professionals and leadership teams to build effective employee retention strategies.

This project leverages supervised machine learning techniques to model and predict attrition using real-world HR data, offering a data-driven approach to support strategic decision-making.

## Objectives

- Develop predictive models using supervised learning algorithms.
- Evaluate and compare model performance within an HR analytics context.
- Identify the most influential features that contribute to employee attrition.
- Gain practical experience in applying machine learning to real-world business scenarios.

---

## Methodology

We apply the following machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  

The models are trained and tested on a dataset that includes various employee attributes, with **Attrition** as the target variable. Data preprocessing steps such as encoding, scaling, and class balancing (e.g., SMOTE) are also applied.

# Machine Learning Libraries:

- scikit-learn: for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- pandas and numpy: for data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib and seaborn: for data visualization.

## Expected Outcomes

- Develop high-performing predictive models for employee attrition.
- Discover key insights into the main factors influencing employee turnover.
- Provide HR with actionable recommendations to help reduce attrition risk.
- Demonstrate the effectiveness of ML in solving HR-related business problems.
